I'm an independent developer from Melbourne, Australia.

I am involved with technology community groups [WIRED Monash](https://wired.org.au) (President), and the Australian Computing Students' Association (President and Founder).

Want to talk or have some feedback on one of my projects? [Please get in touch](mailto:gavindouch@gmail.com).
