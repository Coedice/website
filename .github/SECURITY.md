# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability
Please email
[gavindouch@gmail.com](mailto:gavindouch@gmail.com) to report
vulnerabilities.

Even when unsure whether the bug in question is an exploitable
vulnerability, it is recommended to send the report to
[gavindouch@gmail.com](mailto:gavindouch@gmail.com)
(and obviously not to discuss the issue anywhere else).

Vulnerabilities are expected to be discussed _only_ in that
email thread, and not in public, until the patch is released.

Examples for details to include:
- A description of the vulnerability
- Ideally a script (or a description) to demonstrate an
  exploit.
- The affected platforms and scenarios (the vulnerability might
  only affect setups with case-sensitive file systems, for
  example).
- The name and affiliation of the security researchers who are
  involved in the discovery, if any.
- Whether the vulnerability has already been disclosed.
- How long an embargo would be required to be safe.

# Discovery credit
Discovered vulnerabilities will be acknowledged in this repo
once they are patched, along with credit to their discoverer(s).
